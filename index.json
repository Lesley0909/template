Informal education based on public facilities, such as museums and memorials, is an important propaganda practice in authoritarian countries. However, the empirical research on this area is underdeveloped and relies on small and potentially biased samples. Method. This study collects unique spatial-opinion data of over 300 such informal education facilities in China merged with original survey data and conducts a systematic evaluation of this form of propaganda. Result. The statistical results challenge the conventional expectation that more exposure to the informal education facilities would improve the citizens' support and obedience to the government. Conclusion. The findings reveal a backfire effect of informal education facilities that more exposure to them reduces both citizens' political support and obedience.","tags":["communication","methodology"],"title":"Are Informal Education Facilities Effective Means for Generating Political Support?

To provide empirical support for this thesis, we first justify our case for analysis by discussing the significance of voting in authoritarian systems. While scholars have explained the function of semi-competitive elections in non-democratic systems, few have actually studied how citizens make their electoral choices in such contexts. We fill this gap by validating a \"demobilization\" model of voting in competitive authoritarian regimes. We show that even though voting in such systems is unlikely to bring about regime change, citizens do use elections to express their political preferences and their opinions about the performance of their leaders. Most significant is our identification of two causal paths by which individual contact with corrupt officials undermines Vladimir Putin's electoral support. Our demobilization model also specifies the nuanced mechanisms, both direct and indirect, by which other well-established predictors affect turnout and vote choice in an authoritarian context.","tags":["others"],"title":"Tsar Putin and the `Corruption' Thorn in his Side: The Demobilization of Votes in a Competitive Authoritarian Regime","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Frederick Solt","Yue Hu","Kevan Hudson","Jungmin Song","Dong 'Erico' Yu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483200000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541979725,"objectID":"354ebf010cd64b19b992ef8dfb76b57c","permalink":"/publication/solt2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/solt2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Do contexts of greater income inequality spur the disadvantaged to achieve a class consciousness vital to contesting the fairness of the economic system and demanding more redistribution?
