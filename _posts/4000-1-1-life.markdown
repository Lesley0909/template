I was born in Tianjin, a beautiful port city of China.
As shown on the left map, it locates right at the "neck," if you picture the shape of the nation as a rooster, and quite near Beijing (only 80 miles away).
As the "Eastern Gate" of the capital, the city has served as an important political and economic center and transport hub of the country since Ming Dynasty (1360 A.C.D., see the view of the city in the second and third panel on the left). 
Quite a few famous politicians lived in here before or after their administrations in Beijing;
many profound events in Chinese domestic and foreign politics also happened in the city.

Starting from exploring these political figures and stories, I gradually developed an interest in political topics and finally decided to push this personal interest to a professional level by studying political science systematically in the college. 
In 2005, I was admitted to Nankai University, the alma mater of two prime ministers of the P.R.China, majoring international politics. 
Nankai provided me the first chance of learning the modern western political theories and scientific research methods and cultivated my interests in studying Chinese politics and international cultural diplomacy.
During this time, I published my first couple of research articles about the Chinese political institutions and foreign policy in academic journals in China.

After earning a B.L.L., I went to Canada and U.S.A. to learn advanced political theory and research approaches.
In the four-year experience, I not only kept working on the cultural diplomacy topic but became fascinated by Chinese mass politics and political research methodology.
With the passion, I entered the Ph.D. program at the University of Iowa to explore my interests further, and I found great gratification at the program. 

In my leisure time, I enjoy exploring new places, trying novel activities, and talking with various people.
The selected pictures following captures some interesting moments in my lovely life.
