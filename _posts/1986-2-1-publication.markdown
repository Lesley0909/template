### Journal Article

* Hu, Yue. "Are Informal Education Facilities Effective Means for Generating Political Support? A Spatial Analysis." *Social Science Quarterly*, (2018): Forthcoming.

	<sub>**Abstract**: *Object*. Informal education based on public facilities, such as museums and memorials, is an important propaganda practice in authoritarian countries. However, the empirical research on this area is underdeveloped and relies on small and potentially biased samples. *Method*. This study collects unique spatial-opinion data of over 300 such informal education facilities in China merged with original survey data and conducts a systematic evaluation of this form of propaganda. *Result*. The statistical results challenge the conventional expectation that more exposure to the informal education facilities would improve the citizens' support and obedience to the government. *Conclusion*. The findings reveal a backfire effect of informal education facilities that more exposure to them reduces both citizens’ political support and obedience.</sub><br><br>

"[Tsar Putin and the 'Corruption' Thorn in his Side: The Demobilization of Votes in a Competitive Authoritarian Regime](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379417304304)." *Electoral Studies*, 54 (2018): 182-204.

	<sub>**Abstract**: We argue that personal exposure to corrupt transactions with bureaucrats, many of whom are the only representatives of the state people encounter, leads citizens to conclude that politicians are corrupt and undeserving of electoral support. To provide empirical support for this thesis, we analyze 2,000 responses from face-to-face interviews conducted in Russia in June-July 2015. Using both behavioral and perceptual measures of corruption, we test for both the suppressive effect of corruption on the act of voting (turnout) as well as the negative effect of corruption on Putin's vote share via increased support of oppositional candidates. We display, justify, and test a structural equation model of "demobilized voting" in competitive authoritarian regimes. Most significant is our identification of two causal paths by which individual contact with corrupt officials undermines Putin's support.</sub><br><br>

    <sub>**Abstract**: Do contexts of greater income inequality spur the disadvantaged to achieve a class consciousness vital to contesting the fairness of the economic system and demand- ing more redistribution? One prominent recent study, Newman, Johnston, and Lown (2015), argues that simple exposure to higher levels of local income inequality lead low-income people to view the United States as divided into haves and have-nots and to see themselves as among the have-nots, that is, to become more likely to achieve such a class consciousness. Here, we show that this sanguine conclusion is at best supported only in analyses of the single survey presented in that study. There is no evidence that higher levels of income inequality produce greater class consciousness among those with low incomes in other similar but neglected surveys.</sub><br><br>

    <sub>**Abstract**: How does the context of income inequality in which people live affect their belief in meritocracy, the ability to get ahead through hard work? One prominent recent study, Newman, Johnston, and Lown (2015a), argues that, consistent with the confict theory, exposure to higher levels of local income inequality lead lower-income people to become more likely to reject|and higher-income people to become more likely to accept the dominant U.S. ideology of meritocracy. Here, we show that this conclusion is not supported by the study's own reported results and that even these results depend on pooling three different measures of meritocracy into a single analysis. We then demonstrate that analysis of a larger and more representative survey employing a single consistent measure of the dependent variable yields the opposite conclusion. Consistent with the relative power theory, among those with lower incomes, local contexts of greater inequality are associated with more widespread belief that people can get ahead if they are willing to work hard.</sub><br><br>

    <sub>**Abstract**: This study finds that the Mandarin proficiency is partially responsible for the gap in socioeconomic inequality between the Han majority and the Uyghur Muslim minority. Multiple sources of evidence show that Uyghur Muslims share equal educational attainment as the Han majority, but are noticeably less fluent in Mandarin than the Han majority. Using data from the 2012 China Labor-Force Dynamics Survey (CLDS), we find that Mandarin proficiency can significantly improve occupational attainment and income. In other words, holding other factors equal, if ethnic minorities speak better Mandarin, they would have better chances to improve their socioeconomic status.</sub><br><br>

    <sub>**Abstract**: This study discusses the ability of culture to affect a state’s foreign policies in terms of cultural diplomacy, concentrating on the institutional level. It argues that one way a culture may affect a state’s cultural diplomacy is in making national institutions have features similar to the cultural features. Using China and Canada for comparative analysis, this article tests the theory that a state’s institutions of cultural diplomacy have features paralleling its own culture. This examination demonstrates that China and Canada, two states with different cultures, have different features in their institutions of cultural diplomacy that are consistent with Chinese and Canadian cultures respectively, thus supporting the validity of the theory.</sub><br><br>

### Dissertation
*Rebuilding the Tower of Babel: Language Policy and Political Trust in China*

<sub>**Abstract**: My dissertation explores how authoritarian governments use language policy to impact public political trust. Based on a comprehensive examination through survey analyses, experiments, and large-scale text analyses, my research demonstrates that authoritarian governments, such as in China, can use language policy as a political tool to influence citizens’ political attitudes. In particular, language policy empowers the official language used by government representatives, such as street-level bureaucrats, reinforcing their political identities and enhancing citizens’ trust in them. Using an original randomized experiment in China based on a new sociolinguistic technique, my research finds robust evidence that listeners hold significantly more trust in bureaucrats who speak the official language than in those who speak dialects, even if the respondent and government representative share the same dialect. Furthermore, my research shows that language not only influences citizens’ political trust but also their understanding of political concepts. Using a computer-assisted text analysis of over one million articles from the official newspaper of the dominant party of China from 1946-2003, I indicate a refocusing strategy by which the official discourse about democracy manipulates the meaning of democracy in the Chinese political language without contradicting with the Western democratic values, while simultaneously preserving the authoritarian regime. Drawing on multiple waves of nationally representative surveys from China, my dissertation also identifies distinctive effects of improving listening, speaking, and relative proficiencies of Putonghua on Chinese citizens’ political interest, efficacy, pursuit, and institutional-based political trust. This study contributes to political science, and even the entire social science by justifying the important role of language in human social and political lives and turning the research focus from language content to language context.</sub><br><br>
