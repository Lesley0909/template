 abstract = {This study discusses the ability of culture to affect a state's foreign policies in terms of cultural diplomacy, concentrating on the institutional level. It argues that one way a culture may affect a state's cultural diplomacy is in making national institutions have features similar to the cultural features. Using China and Canada for comparative analysis, this article tests the theory that a state's institutions of cultural diplomacy have features paralleling its own culture. This examination demonstrates that China and Canada, two states with different cultures, have different features in their institutions of cultural diplomacy that are consistent with Chinese and Canadian cultures respectively, thus supporting the validity of the theory.},
