abstract = "In this article, we argue that citizens' personal exposure to corrupt transactions with bureaucrats, many of whom are the only representatives of the state these people encounter, leads to a conclusion that the political leadership is corrupt and, therefore, undeserving of electoral support. To provide empirical support for this thesis, we first justify our case for analysis by discussing the significance of voting in authoritarian systems. While scholars have explained the function of semi-competitive elections in non-democratic systems, few have actually studied how citizens make their electoral choices in such contexts. We fill this gap by validating a \"demobilization\" model of voting in competitive authoritarian regimes. We show that even though voting in such systems is unlikely to bring about regime change, citizens do use elections to express their political preferences and their opinions about the performance of their leaders. Most significant is our identification of two causal paths by which individual contact with corrupt officials undermines Vladimir Putin's electoral support. Our demobilization model also specifies the nuanced mechanisms, both direct and indirect, by which other well-established predictors affect turnout and vote choice in an authoritarian context."
