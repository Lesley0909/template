              <hr class="section-heading-spacer"><br/>
              <font size="4px">
              <br/>
                <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate (A.B.D.) in <a href="https://clas.uiowa.edu/polisci/">Department of Political Science</a> of the <a href="https://uiowa.edu/">University of Iowa</a>.</p>
                <p>My research interest primarily lies in <font color="Tomato">language policy</font> and <font color="Tomato">political communication</font>. I particularly focuses on how language policy affects citizens' political attitudes, relations, and value system and how the government-to-citizen communications are conducted and impact public opinions.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>As a methodologist, I am interested in the applications and developments of <font color="LimeGreen">survey experiments, text analysis, network analysis, spatial analysis, and multilevel analysis</font>. In international relations, I explore the peaceful rising in the contemporary interdependent international system, the cultural diplomacy and diplomatic institutions, and the influences of the economic inequality on the mass political beliefs and opinions.</p>
