              <font size="4px">
              <br/>
                <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://clas.uiowa.edu/polisci/">Department of Political Science</a> of the <a href="https://uiowa.edu/">University of Iowa</a>.</p>
                <p>My research lies in comparative politics, methodology, and international relations. My primary research agenda focuses on <font color="Tomato"> political communication</font> and <font color="Tomato">language politics in China</font>. Specifically, I investigate the impacts of the single-official-language policy on the Chinese mass politcs and government-to-citizen communications.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>As a methodologist, I primarily focus on the applications and developments of <font color="LimeGreen">survey experiments, text analysis, network analysis, spatial analysis, and multilevel analysis</font>. My other work explores the peaceful power rising in the contemporary interdependent international system, the cultural diplomacy and diplomatic institutions, and the influences of the economic inequality on the mass political beliefs and opinions.</p>
