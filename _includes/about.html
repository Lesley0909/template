                <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://clas.uiowa.edu/polisci/">Department of Political Science</a> of the <a href="https://uiowa.edu/">University of Iowa</a>.</p>
                <p>His research interest primarily lies in <font color="Tomato">political communication</font> and <font color="Tomato">public opinion</font>. I particularly focuses on the government-to-citizen and citizen-to-citizen communications in China and their influences on the political opinions and attitudes of the citizens there.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>As a methodologist, I primarily focus on the applications and developments of <font color="LimeGreen">survey experiments, text analysis, network analysis, spatial analysis, and multilevel analysis</font>. My other work explores the peaceful power rising in the contemporary interdependent international system, the cultural diplomacy and diplomatic institutions, and the influences of the economic inequality on the mass political beliefs and opinions.</p>
